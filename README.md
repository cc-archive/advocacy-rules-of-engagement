# advocacy-rules-of-engagement

In 2013, in response to issues like SOPA, CC has tried to be more transparent, deliberate, and consultative with the Creative Commons affiliate community about decisionmaking, especially in relation to Creative Commons engaging in policy and advocacy activities. With staff, affiliate, and board input, we developed a set of "Policy & Advocacy Guidelines" (see https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Policy_Advocacy_Guidelines). We will revisit these guidelines and update them in order to be more clear about when and how Creative Commons will get involved in issue campaigns and policy actions.
